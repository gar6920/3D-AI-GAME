# Entity Selection System PRD

## Project Overview
The 3D AI Game requires a robust and extensible entity selection system that works across all camera modes and supports various entity types. This system is fundamental to player interaction with the game world.

## Core Requirements

### Universal Selection System
- Players must be able to select any entity (structures, NPCs, players) in any camera mode
- Support for both single-click and box selection methods
- Selection must work consistently across RTS, first-person, and third-person views
- Visual feedback must clearly indicate selected entities

### Technical Architecture
- Client-server architecture with server authority
- Real-time synchronization of selection state
- Efficient handling of multiple simultaneous selections
- Integration with the physics system for precise collision detection

### Selection Features
1. Selection Methods
   - Single-click selection via raycasting
   - Box/drag selection for multiple entities
   - Support for selecting entities through colliders
   - Proper handling of skinned meshes and complex models

2. Visual Feedback
   - Clear highlighting of selected entities
   - Different highlight styles for different entity types
   - Real-time updates of selection state
   - Support for showing selection radius/bounds

3. Selection Data Management
   - Efficient caching of selectable meshes
   - Proper handling of entity hierarchies
   - Support for entity groups and mass selection

### UI Requirements
1. Context Panel
   - Display selected entity information
   - Show available actions based on entity type
   - Real-time updates of entity state
   - Support for multiple selected entities

2. Action System
   - Contextual actions based on entity type
   - Action validation on both client and server
   - Visual feedback for action execution
   - Support for action queuing

### Networking Requirements
1. Client-Server Communication
   - Efficient selection state synchronization
   - Server validation of selection requests
   - Real-time updates of entity states
   - Handling of network latency and disconnections

2. Security
   - Server authority over all selections
   - Validation of action requests
   - Anti-cheat measures for selection

## Technical Specifications

### Entity Components
- Collider system for precise selection
- Support for both sphere and box colliders
- Integration with existing physics system
- Proper scaling and positioning of colliders

### Performance Requirements
- Support for 100+ selectable entities
- Maximum 16ms processing time for selection operations
- Efficient handling of continuous selection updates
- Optimized network message size

### Integration Points
- Physics system integration
- UI system integration
- Networking system integration
- Entity management system integration

## Success Criteria
1. Players can reliably select any valid entity in any view mode
2. Selection feedback is clear and immediate
3. Selection state remains consistent across network conditions
4. System handles complex models and skinned meshes correctly
5. Performance meets specified requirements
6. All selection-related actions are properly validated

## Future Considerations
- Support for new entity types
- Advanced selection patterns (double-click, hotkeys)
- Custom selection rules per entity type
- Enhanced visual feedback options
